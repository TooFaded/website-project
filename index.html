    <p class="mushOne">Oysters are a rich source of vitamin D, copper, zinc, and manganese. 
        These micronutrients, in combination with calcium, are thought to be key to 
        slowing or even preventing bone loss in older women due to osteoporosis. 
        Additionally, dietary sources of these minerals are thought to be more 
        effective than supplements.</p>
   
   
   
   
    <p class="mushThree">Reishi mushroom has been used to help enhance the immune system, reduce stress, improve sleep, 
        and lessen fatigue. People also take reishi mushroom for health conditions such as: 
        High blood pressure.</p>

    
    
    <p>Research has found that lion's mane may protect against dementia, reduce mild symptoms of 
        anxiety and depression and help repair nerve damage. It also has strong anti-inflammatory, 
        antioxidant and immune-boosting abilities and been shown to lower the risk of heart disease, 
        cancer, ulcers and diabetes in animals.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="mushTwo">Shiitake mushrooms are high in B vitamins, and they serve as a food source of vitamin D. 
    Some shiitake health benefits include the ability to aid weight loss, support cardiovascular health, 
    fight cancer cells, improve energy levels and brain function, reduce inflammation, and support the immune system.</p>

    <p>Mushrooms provide a vast array of potential medicinal compounds. 
        Many mushrooms - such as portobello, oyster, reishi and maitake - 
        are well-known for these properties, but the lion's mane mushroom, 
        in particular, has drawn the attention of researchers for its notable nerve-regenerative properties.</p>
