    <p>Mushrooms provide a vast array of potential medicinal compounds. 
        Many mushrooms - such as portobello, oyster, reishi and maitake - 
        are well-known for these properties, but the lion's mane mushroom, 
        in particular, has drawn the attention of researchers for its notable nerve-regenerative properties.
